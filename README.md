# reblued 
A modern alternative to BlueZ.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is pre-alpha code, it doesn't even connect to the Kernel's bluetooth system yet, and so it isn't even possible to test it. Please keep an eye on this repo for future developments.

## For collaborators

If you know anything about Rust, D-Bus, HCI sockets, the Bluetooth specification or BlueZ, please help.
You can find some interesting things (parts of my research about Bluetooth & Linux; and the structure of this codebase) in the DOCUMENTS.md document.
If you want to help but don't know where to start, head to the "New Collaborators" discussion.
